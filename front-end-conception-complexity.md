# WIP : Front end conception & complexity

## Tasks

### Identification

- **Why ?** : Save your time
- **Why ?** : Use Design System instead of recreate components
- **Why ?** : Prepare your data before your app

- Design System
- Components (Think Atomic design)
- Data (Mock)
- User Interactions

### Creation

When you finish identification you can start to code !

- Component 
- Fetch Data (With Mock)
- Component assembly to create view (Without logic)
- Uer interactions

## Validate the Design

To check : 
- 8px grid system : Check every space to be a multiple of 8
- Design system component identification

## Cut your design

- **Why ?** : Identify the amount of work by component.

Two categories : 
- Component from Design System
- Component only for this app

## Complexity

- **Why ?** : Complexity is better than day of work.
- **Why ?** : Complexity is not difficulty

For :
- Components (Only for this app)
- View :
