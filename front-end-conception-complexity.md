# WIP : Front end conception & complexity defined

## Tasks

- Design System Identification
- Component Identification (Think Atomic design)
- Component Creation
- Component assembly to create view (Without logic)
- Fetch Data (With Mock)
- Add user interactions

## Validate the Design

To check : 
- 8px grid system : Check every space to be a multiple of 8

## Cut your design

Why ? : Identify the amount of work by component.

Two categories : 
- Component from Design System
- Component only for this app

## Complexity

- Why ? : Complexity is better than day of work.
- Why ? : Complexity is not difficulty

For :
- Components (Only for this app)
- View :
